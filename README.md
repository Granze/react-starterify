# React Starterify

A minimal React JS application starter kit.

## Start small, add what you need.

React Starterify aims to give you a good starting point for your projects.
If you're looking for a minimal ES6 (ES2015) React JS starter with nice [shallow rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) test examples, this is probably for you.

## Why there are no Flux or Isomorphic things inside?

If you are a beginner, you probably don't want a complex structure with lots of things to care about.
If you are an advanced user, and you need more features, you can choose one of the thousand existing full-stack starter kit. Or you can build your own.
